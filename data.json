    "Sentence": "Laing O’Rourke was formed in 2001, bringing together the experience of the construction arm of John Laing Plc, whose origins stretched back to 1848, and R O’Rourke & Son, a regionally based formwork and concrete specialist founded in 1978. The new business has grown and become a renowned international engineering and construction company.\n\nIn the two decades since it was founded, Laing O'Rourke has expanded into new markets and strengthened its project delivery capabilities; pioneering modern methods of construction, adopting purposeful technologies, delivering certainty for clients, and constructing some of the most iconic projects in the world.\n\nOur purpose—to push the boundaries of what's possible in service of humanity—together with our values of care, integrity, and courage, are what make us unique in who we are and drive the impact we want to have as a business in the world. At our core is the ambition to be a force of positive change in our industry.\n\nOur strong culture stems from our family ownership and a passion to deliver projects that improve the lives of the communities they serve.\n\nOur Origin Story, told by our own people, connects the threads of our past to the ambitions of our future and shows that our purpose and values matter now more than ever. They provide our reference point to test our decision-making and actions, and they inspire us, as they always have, to find better and new ways to deliver.",
